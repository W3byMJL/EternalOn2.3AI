        <h3>:Flash</h3>

        <p>Flash takes in a DC input set to a constant current, and distributes this around the various coils in the core 
            using "velocity gates" controlled by an FPGA. By varying the pattern and speed of the current, the power output of this device
        can be manipulated and higher efficiences can be gained.
